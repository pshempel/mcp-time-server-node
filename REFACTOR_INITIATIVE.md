# Refactoring Initiative

**Started:** 2025-07-31 14:55 EDT

## Objective
Reduce code duplication from 18% to under 5% through systematic refactoring.

## Approach
- 6-phase TDD-driven refactoring
- Feature flags for safe rollout  
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Atomic commits with clear history

## Timeline
Estimated duration: 7-8 days

## Phases
1. **Phase 0: Safety Net** - Baseline tests and feature flags (4 hours)
2. **Phase 1: Date Parser** - Extract universal parsing (~80 lines saved)
3. **Phase 2: Cache Wrapper** - Generic caching pattern (~120 lines saved)
4. **Phase 3: Timezone Resolver** - Standardize timezone handling (~60 lines saved)
5. **Phase 4: Error Factory** - Consistent error handling (~100 lines saved)
6. **Phase 5: Debug Logger** - Decorator-based logging (~150 lines saved)

## Success Metrics
- Code duplication: 18% â†’ <5%
- All 905+ tests passing
- No performance regression
- Improved maintainability

## Git Strategy
Following the approach documented in `docs/GIT_REFACTORING_STRATEGY.md`:
- Main feature branch: `refactor/deduplication-initiative`
- Sub-branches for each phase
- Atomic commits with clear messages
- Feature flags for rollback capability
