# MaxListenersExceededWarning Fix Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-19

## Summary
✅ **FIX VERIFIED WORKING** - No warnings appeared during testing

## Fix Details
- **Commit**: a591953 - "fix: prevent MaxListenersExceededWarning in MCP server"
- **Solution**: Increased EventEmitter maxListeners from default 10 to 20
- **Implementation**: `src/utils/serverConfig.ts` called at server startup

## Test Results

### Test 1: Baseline (5 concurrent calls) ✅
- **Result**: Success, no warnings
- **Response Time**: ~5 seconds
- **All responses**: Correct

### Test 2: At Original Limit (10 concurrent calls) ✅
- **Result**: Success, no warnings
- **Note**: This is where warning would have appeared before fix
- **Response Time**: ~10 seconds
- **All responses**: Correct

### Test 3: Above Original Limit (15 concurrent calls) ✅
- **Result**: Success, no warnings
- **Note**: Definitely would have triggered warning before fix
- **Response Time**: ~10 seconds
- **All responses**: Correct

### Test 4: At New Limit (20 concurrent calls) ✅
- **Result**: Success, no warnings
- **Note**: Testing exactly at the new maxListeners limit
- **Response Time**: ~10 seconds
- **All responses**: Correct

## Tools Tested
All 8 MCP time server tools were tested:
- get_current_time (multiple timezones)
- convert_timezone
- add_time
- subtract_time
- calculate_duration
- get_business_days
- next_occurrence
- format_time

## Conclusion
The fix successfully prevents the MaxListenersExceededWarning for up to 20 concurrent MCP calls. The warning that was appearing at 11 listeners (above the default 10) is now prevented by increasing the limit to 20.

## Recommendations
1. The current fix is sufficient for normal usage patterns
2. If users need more than 20 concurrent calls, consider:
   - Further increasing the limit
   - Implementing request queuing
   - Adding documentation about concurrent call limits

## Build Verification
- Built with: `npm run build`
- Server location: `dist/index.js`
- Configuration applied at startup via `configureServer()`
