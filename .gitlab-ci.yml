# GitLab CI/CD Configuration
# Currently disabled - but planned as testing ground for GitHub Actions

# Disable all pipelines (for now)
workflow:
  rules:
    - when: never

# FUTURE: Use GitLab CI as private testing before GitHub
# Benefits:
# - Test CI/CD changes privately before going public
# - Run full test suite on every commit (not just PR)
# - Test release process without affecting public packages
# - Experiment with deployment strategies

# TODO Phase 1: Basic Testing Pipeline
# test:
#   image: node:20
#   script:
#     - npm ci
#     - npm run lint
#     - npm test
#     - npm run build

# TODO Phase 2: Release Preparation
# release-dry-run:
#   image: node:20
#   script:
#     - npm ci
#     - npm run build
#     - npm pack --dry-run
#     - echo "Would publish version $(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
#   only:
#     - tags

# TODO Phase 3: Mirror successful patterns to GitHub Actions
# After GitLab CI proves stable, port to .github/workflows/
